I\u0027ll leave, just hold me closer baby,  \r\nAnd make me crazy for you.  \r\nCrazy for you.  \r\n  \r\nLately with this state I\u0027m in I can\u0027t help myself but spin.  \r\nI wish you\u0027d come over,  \r\nSend me spinning closer to you.  \r\n  \r\nMy oh my, how my blood boils, it\u0027s sweet taste for you,  \r\nStrips me down bare  \r\nAnd gets me into my favorite mood.  \r\n  \r\nI keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,  \r\nBut the more I do,  \r\nThe crazier I turn into.  \r\n  \r\nPacing floors and opening doors,  \r\nHoping you\u0027ll walk through  \r\nAnd save me boy,  \r\nBecause I\u0027m too crazy for you.  \r\nCrazy for you\r\n\r\n"

Cle  \r\n  \r\nIt was late last night the other day  \r\nI thought I\u0027d go up and see Ray  \r\nSo l went up and I saw Ray  \r\nThere was only one thing Ray could say, was:  \r\n  \r\nChorus  \r\n  \r\nThis song is about the time that I was ridin\u0027 my motorcycle.  \r\nGoing down a mountain road, at 150 miles an hour, playin\u0027  \r\nMy guitar. On one side of the mountain road there was a  \r\nMountain, and on the other side there was nothin\u0027 - there was  \r\nA cliff in the air.  \r\n  \r\nNow, when you\u0027re going down a mountain road at I50 miles  \r\nAn hour you gotta be very careful, especially if you\u0027re playin\u0027  \r\nA guitar. Especially if that guitar is an acoustic guitar.  \r\nBecause if it\u0027s an acoustic guitar, the wind pressure is greater  \r\nOn the box side than on the neck side, because there\u0027s  \r\nMore guitar on the box side. I wasn\u0027t payin\u0027 attention..  \r\n  \r\nLuckily I didn\u0027t go into the mountain - I went over the cliff.  \r\nI was goin\u0027 at 150 miles an hour sideways and 500 feet down  \r\nAt the same time.  \r\n  \r\nI knew it was the end. I looked down, I said \u0027\u0027Wow! Some  \r\nTrip\". I thought it... Well I knew it was... I knew it was my last  \r\nTrip, and in my last remaining seconds in world, I decided  \r\nTo write one last farewell song to the world.  \r\n  \r\nPut a new ink cartridge in my pen. Took out a piece of paper.  \r\nI sat back and I thought awhile. Then I started writin\u0027:  \r\nI don\u0027t want a pickle  \r\nJust want to ride on my motorsickle  \r\nAnd I don\u0027t want a tickle  \r\n\u0027Cause I\u0027d rather ride on my motorsickle  \r\n  \r\nAnd I don\u0027t want to die  \r\nJust want to ride on my motorcy... Cle. \"  \r\n  \r\nI knew that, it wasn\u0027t the best song l ever wrote, but I didn\u0027t  \r\nHave time to change it. I was comin\u0027 down mighty fast.  \r\n  \r\nBut as you all know, and as fate would have it, I didn\u0027t die. I  \r\nLanded on the top of a police car. And he died. I drove away  \r\nOn the road that he was on. I came into town at a screamin\u0027  \r\n175 miles an hour, playin\u0027 the motorcycle song.  \r\n  \r\nI came into town, I jumped off my bike, the bike went around  \r\nThe corner by itself, went up on the stand by itself, turned  \r\nItself off.  \r\n  \r\nI walked over to my friend. He was standin\u0027 there eatin\u0027  \r\nPickles. I said \"Hi, what\u0027s happenin\u0027?\" He looked at me in the  \r\nEye and said \"Nothin\u0027\".  \r\n  \r\nYou gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm. Like you just  \r\nSquashed a cop...  \r\n  \r\nChorus\r\n\r\n"

Tonight I\u0027d like to dedicate this to our boys  \r\nIn the FBI.  \r\n  \r\nWell, wait a minute. It\u0027s hard to be an FBI man. I mean, first  \r\nOf all, being an FBI man, you have to be over 40 years old.  \r\nAnd the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the  \r\nOrganization to be that much of a bastard. It\u0027s true. You just  \r\nCan\u0027t join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your  \r\nNatural bastardness can grow and develop and take a  \r\nMeaningful shape in today\u0027s complex society.  \r\n  \r\nBut that\u0027s not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI. I  \r\nMean, the job that they have to do is a drag. I mean, they have  \r\nTo follow people around, you know. That\u0027s part of their job.  \r\nFollow me around.  \r\n  \r\nI\u0027m out on the highway and I\u0027m drivin\u0027 down the road and I  \r\nRun out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They  \r\nGotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you  \r\nKnow.  \r\n  \r\nI go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether  \r\nThey should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don\u0027t  \r\nCome back and they\u0027re stayin\u0027 with the car.  \r\n  \r\nOr if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I\u0027m 12  \r\nTo 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that  \r\nWhen you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane  \r\nFirst, so that they know how many seats are left over for the  \r\nHalf fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren\u0027t any seats  \r\nLeft over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn\u0027t mean that  \r\nYou have to go.  \r\n  \r\nSuppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can\u0027t  \r\nGet on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What\u0027s he gonna  \r\nDo?  \r\n  \r\nWell, it\u0027s a drag for him. But that\r\n\r\n"
